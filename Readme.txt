Loan Prediction:

Python code is used to detect whether the loan is approved or rejected for given input using below methods

Method 1: Logistic Regression
Method 2: Support Vector Machine
Method 3: Random Forest

Step 1: Audited the file to detect data types & missing values

Step 2: Replacing the missing values either by replacing with most repeating values or by median of the column datas

Step 3: Developing a model using methods mentioned above

Step 4: Predicting the output using confusion matrix

Step 5: Implementing the model on test dataset
